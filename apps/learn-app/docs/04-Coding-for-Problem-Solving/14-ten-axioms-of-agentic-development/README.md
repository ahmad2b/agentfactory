# Chapter 14: Ten Axioms of Agentic Development

## Overview

This chapter bridges Parts 1-3 (experiential learning) with Parts 4-6 (technical implementation), formalizing the developer methodology that has been implicit throughout your work so far. Through General Agents, Applied Workflows, and SDD-RI, you have already practiced these axioms without naming them. Now we make them explicit, providing the rigorous foundation that governs all subsequent Python programming and agent-building work.

The Ten Axioms are not abstract theory. They are distilled from real agentic development practice and directly extend the Seven Principles introduced in Chapter 4.

## Relationship to the Seven Principles (Chapter 4)

| Dimension | Seven Principles | Ten Axioms |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Audience** | ALL users of AI agents | DEVELOPERS building agents |
| **Scope** | Mindset and approach | Methodology and practice |
| **Level** | How to think about agent work | How to engineer agent systems |
| **Introduced** | Part 1 (foundations) | Part 4 (technical bridge) |

The Principles tell you *how to think*. The Axioms tell you *how to build*.

## The Ten Axioms

| # | Axiom | Principle Connection | Core Teaching |
|---|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| I | Shell as Orchestrator | P1: Bash is the Key | Shell coordinates all tools; programs compute |
| II | Knowledge is Markdown | P5: Persisting State | Markdown is the universal knowledge format |
| III | Programs Over Scripts | P2: Code as Interface | Production requires typed programs with tests and CI |
| IV | Composition Over Monoliths | P4: Decomposition | Build from composable, focused units |
| V | Types Are Guardrails | P6: Constraints | Type systems prevent errors before runtime |
| VI | Data is Relational | P5: Persisting State | SQL as default for structured data |
| VII | Tests Are the Specification | P3: Verification | TDG: tests define correctness |
| VIII | Version Control is Memory | P5: Persisting State | Git as persistent memory layer |
| IX | Verification is a Pipeline | P3: Verification | CI/CD automates verification |
| X | Observability Extends Verification | P7: Observability | Runtime monitoring extends testing |

## Layer Progression

| Lessons | Layer | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 01-04 | L1 (Manual) | Introduce axioms conceptually with concrete examples |
| 05-07 | L2 (Collaboration) | Explore axioms with AI assistance |
| 08-10 | L2 to L3 | Axioms compose into integrated systems |

## Prerequisites

- **Part 1**: General Agents Foundations (Chapters 1-4)
- **Part 2**: Applied General Agent Workflows (Chapters 5-10)
- **Part 3**: SDD-RI Fundamentals (Chapters 11-13)

## What You'll Learn

- How the shell serves as an orchestration layer distinct from computation
- Why markdown is the universal knowledge format for agent workflows
- The difference between disposable scripts and production programs
- How composition, types, and relational data create robust agent systems
- Test-Driven Generation (TDG) as the specification mechanism for AI-generated code
- Git as persistent memory and CI/CD as automated verification
- How observability extends verification from build-time into runtime
