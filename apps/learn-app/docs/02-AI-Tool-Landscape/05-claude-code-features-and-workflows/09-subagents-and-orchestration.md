# Subagents and Orchestration

A subagent is a specialized AI Agent with its own instructions and isolated context window. Each subagent is an expert at one type of task.

Think of Claude Code as a project manager with a team of specialists:
- **Claude Code (main)**: Coordinates overall work
- **Plan subagent**: Researches your codebase and creates multi-step plans
- **Custom subagents**: You can create specialists for your team's specific needs (content planning, research synthesis, document structuring, etc.)

You already have a team of AI specialists. Let's meet them.

## You Already Have a Team

Run this command in Claude Code right now:

```
/agents
```

**What you'll see**:
```
│ Agents                                                                               │
│ ❯ Create new agent                                                                   │
│                                                                                      │
│   Built-in agents (always available)                                                 │
│   Bash · inherit                                                                     │
│   general-purpose · sonnet                                                           │
│   statusline-setup · sonnet                                                          │
│   Explore · haiku                                                                    │
│   Plan · inherit                                                                     │
│   claude-code-guide · haiku                                                          │
```

These are **subagents**—specialized AI assistants that Claude Code can delegate work to. Each has its own expertise and isolated context window.

**You don't need to create anything yet.** You already have a team ready to work.

---

## Try It Now: Your First Subagent

Let's use the **Explore** subagent to see what's in your current folder.

**Type this in Claude Code**:
```
Use the Explore subagent to tell me what's in this folder and summarize the project structure.
```

**What happens**:
1. Claude Code delegates to the Explore subagent
2. Explore scans your directory with its own clean context
3. Explore returns a summary to main Claude Code
4. You see the results

**Try it!** This is hands-on learning—run it now and see what Explore finds.

---

## Meet the Built-In Agents

| Agent | Best For | Model |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Explore** | Finding files, searching code, understanding codebase structure | Haiku (fast) |
| **Plan** | Complex multi-step tasks, creating implementation strategies | Sonnet (smart) |
| **general-purpose** | Multi-step tasks requiring various tools | Sonnet |
| **Bash** | Command execution tasks | Inherits current |
| **claude-code-guide** | Questions about Claude Code itself | Haiku |

**Key insight**: Claude Code automatically picks the right specialist based on your request. But you can also explicitly invoke any agent.

---

## How Subagents Work?

**Critical concept**: A subagent is invoked **once** for a specific goal, completes its work, and **returns results to main Claude Code**.

**The flow**:
1. Main Claude Code recognizes a task that needs a specialist
2. Launches the subagent with a specific goal
3. Subagent works independently in isolated context
4. Subagent completes its task and returns results
5. **Control returns to main Claude Code**
6. You interact with main Claude Code to proceed

**Think of it like this**: You send a specialist to research something. They go off, do their work, come back with a report, and then you continue the conversation with your main assistant.

### Automatic Delegation

You don't command "use the Plan subagent." Claude Code decides when to delegate based on:
- Task complexity (multi-step tasks trigger Plan)
- Your request type (code review request might trigger a review subagent if you have one)
- Subagent descriptions (Claude matches task to specialist)


---

## Parallel Power: Multiple Agents at Once

Here's where it gets powerful. You can invoke **multiple subagents in a single prompt**.

**Try this**:
```
Use Explore to show me what files are in this project, AND use Plan to outline how I could add a README if one doesn't exist.
```

**What happens**:
- Claude Code launches **both** subagents
- They work in parallel with isolated contexts
- Results combine into a single response

**Real-world example**:
```
Use Explore to find all test files in this project, AND use Plan to suggest a testing strategy for the gaps you find.
```

This is **orchestration**—coordinating multiple specialists toward a goal.

---

## Why Subagents Work: Clean Context

Each subagent has its own **isolated context window**. Why does this matter?

**Without subagents** (one AI doing everything):
1. You ask Claude to research competitors
2. Context fills with research notes
3. You ask Claude to draft a pitch
4. Context is cluttered—Claude might confuse research notes with your pitch

**With subagents**:
1. Research subagent does research, returns clean summary
2. Main Claude receives summary, context stays clean
3. Planning subagent drafts pitch with fresh context
4. Each specialist focuses on one job

**Think of it like a team meeting**: The researcher presents findings, then leaves. The strategist creates a plan with fresh focus. Nobody is juggling everything at once.

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt
> "Explain why subagents use isolated context windows instead of sharing the main conversation. What problems does context isolation solve?"

---

## The Execution Model

**How subagents work**:

```
You → Main Claude Code → Launches Subagent → Subagent works → Returns results → Main Claude Code → You
```

**Key concepts**:
1. **One task, one completion**: Subagent is invoked for a specific goal, completes it, returns
2. **Control returns**: After the subagent finishes, you interact with main Claude Code again
3. **Automatic or explicit**: Claude Code can auto-delegate, or you can request a specific agent

**Automatic triggers**:
- Ask "What files handle authentication?" → Explore auto-activates
- Ask "Help me add user login to this app" → Plan auto-activates (complex task)

**Explicit invocation**:
```
Use the Plan subagent to analyze this feature request.
```

## Hands-On: Create Your First Custom Subagent

Now that you've used built-in agents, let's create your own specialist.

### Step 1: Open the Agent Menu

```
/agents
```

Select **"Create new agent"**

### Step 2: Choose Location

```
│ Choose location                                                               │
│ ❯ 1. Project (.claude/agents/)                                                │
│   2. Personal (~/.claude/agents/)                                             │
```

**Choose 1** (Project)—makes the agent available in this project only.

### Step 3: Choose Creation Method

```
│ Creation method                                                               │
│ ❯ 1. Generate with Claude (recommended)                                       │
│   2. Manual configuration                                                     │
```

**Choose 1**—let Claude generate the agent from your description.

### Step 4: Describe Your Agent

**Type something like**:
```
Help me review code for bugs and suggest improvements.
Use when I say "review this code" or "check for bugs."
```

Claude Code creates:
- Agent name (e.g., `code-reviewer`)
- Instructions based on your description
- Tool permissions
- Saves to `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`

### Step 5: Test It

```
Use the code-reviewer subagent to review this function: [paste your code]
```

**You just created a reusable specialist.**

---

## Where Subagents Live

**Project-level**: `.claude/agents/` (this project only)
**User-level**: `~/.claude/agents/` (all your projects)

**Example file** (`.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`):
```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs and suggests improvements
model: sonnet
---

# Code Review Instructions

When reviewing code:
1. Check for bugs and edge cases
2. Suggest performance improvements
3. Note any security concerns
4. Recommend cleaner patterns
```

---

## More Subagent Ideas

Once you understand the pattern, create specialists for any repeated task:

- **Research subagent**: Deep-dive into documentation, gather requirements
- **Testing subagent**: Generate test cases, identify edge cases
- **Documentation subagent**: Write README files, API docs, architecture notes
- **Refactor subagent**: Suggest cleaner code patterns, reduce complexity

**The pattern**:
1. What expertise does this specialist have?
2. What should it do autonomously?
3. What format should results be in?

### What's Next

Lesson 10 introduces **MCP Integration**—connecting Claude to external systems like web browsers, databases, and documentation servers. Where subagents give you coordination between AI specialists, MCP gives you access to the outside world.
