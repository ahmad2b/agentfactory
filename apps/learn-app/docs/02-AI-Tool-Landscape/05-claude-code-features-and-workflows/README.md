# Chapter 5: Claude Code: Your First General Agent

You know *why* AI-driven development matters—and that it's happening right now, in 2026. But understanding transformation and experiencing it are two different things.

This chapter introduces you to **Claude Code**—not just a coding tool, but a **General Agent**. What's a General Agent? An AI that can reason through problems, make plans, and take action across any domain. Calling Claude Code a "coding agent" is like calling a CEO an "email writer"—code is just how it controls your computer.

The goal is **not to build a supercomputer**, but to establish Claude Code as your **collaborative thinking partner** for everything—and to build Skills that can become products.

## 🎯 Before You Begin

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll have:

- **General Agents Explained** — Understanding why Claude Code is fundamentally different from coding assistants: the OODA reasoning loop, the "Trojan Horse" insight, and code as a universal interface to any domain
- **Claude Code Installed & Working** — Complete setup with **two different paths**: Official Claude Pro/Max subscription (Lesson 2) OR Free Google Gemini backend (Lesson 3). Both teach identical Claude Code skills
- **Hello World** — Mastering the CLI interface (Lesson 4): slash commands, permission loops, and the "Cost Pill" for safe and efficient usage
- **Persistent Project Context** — Creating CLAUDE.md files (Lesson 5) that eliminate repetitive context-sharing and establish team memory
- **Teach Claude Your Way** — Mastering custom instructions (Lesson 6) to align Claude's behavior with your personal or team standards
- **Autonomous Expertise** — Agent Skills (Lessons 7-8) with prompt patterns (Persona + Questions + Principles) and autonomous discovery
- **External Integration** — MCP servers (Lesson 9) for safe access to external systems with practical Playwright and Context7 workflows
- **Token Optimization** — Compiling MCP servers to Skills (Lesson 10) for 80-98% token reduction through progressive disclosure
- **Subagent Orchestration** — Recognizing when Claude automatically delegates to Explore agent or Plan mode (Lesson 11) for complex tasks
- **Configuration Mastery** — Settings hierarchy (Lesson 12) and precedence rules (User, Project, Local) for team collaboration
- **Event-Driven Automation** — Hooks (Lesson 13) for custom behaviors triggered by events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart)
- **Complete Extensibility** — Discovering and using plugins (Lesson 14) from marketplaces like Anthropic's official skills repository
- **Autonomous Iteration** — The Ralph Wiggum Loop (Lesson 15) for self-correcting, multi-step autonomous workflows
- **Strategic Tool Selection** — A decision framework (Lesson 16) for choosing between Skills, Subagents, MCP, and Hooks based on workflow needs
- **The Creator's Workflow** — How Boris Cherny (Lesson 17) uses Claude Code: parallel sessions, Plan Mode discipline, and verification loops
- **From Skills to Business** — Understanding how Skills become monetizable products (Lesson 18), the Digital FTE model, and the path to revenue
