# Plugins: Discover and Install

You've learned to create skills, configure hooks, and use subagents. But what if someone has already built exactly what you need?

---

## What Are Plugins?

A **plugin** bundles multiple Claude Code components into one installable package:

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Skills** | Autonomous capabilities Claude discovers and uses |
| **Commands** | Slash commands like `/commit-commands:commit` |
| **Agents** | Specialized subagents for focused tasks |
| **Hooks** | Event automation (format on save, validate on edit) |
| **MCP servers** | External integrations (GitHub, Slack, etc.) |

**Think of plugins as**: Complete capability packages. Instead of manually setting up skills, hooks, agents, and MCP servers separately, you install one plugin and everything works together.

---

## Why Use Plugins?

**Without plugins**, adding GitHub integration means:
1. Find an MCP server for GitHub
2. Configure it in your settings
3. Maybe create skills to use it well
4. Maybe add hooks for automation
5. Test everything works together

**With plugins**, you run:
```
/plugin install github@claude-plugins-official
```

Done. GitHub integration works—including MCP config, any bundled skills, and automation hooks.

**The principle**: Check what exists before building from scratch.

## You Already Have a Plugin Marketplace

Run this command in Claude Code right now:

```
/plugin
```

**What you'll see**:

The **official Anthropic marketplace** is automatically available. No setup needed.

Use **Tab** to switch between tabs:
- **Discover**: Browse available plugins
- **Installed**: See what you've installed
- **Marketplaces**: Manage plugin sources
- **Errors**: Debug plugin issues

---

## Try It Now: Install Your First Plugin

Let's install **commit-commands**—a plugin that helps with git workflows.

### Option 1: Use the UI

1. Run `/plugin`
2. Go to the **Discover** tab
3. Find **commit-commands** under "Development workflows"
4. Press **Enter** to see details
5. Choose **User scope** (available in all projects)

### Option 2: Install Directly

```
/plugin install commit-commands@claude-plugins-official
```

**What happens**:
- Plugin downloads and installs
- New commands become available immediately
- Plugin appears in your **Installed** tab

---

## Try It Now: Use Your New Plugin

After installing **commit-commands**, make a small change to any file, then run:

```
/commit-commands:commit
```

**What happens**:
1. Plugin stages your changes
2. Generates a commit message based on the diff
3. Creates the commit

**That's it!** You just extended Claude Code with one command.

---

## What's in the Official Marketplace?

| Category | Plugins | What They Do |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Code intelligence** | `typescript-lsp`, `python-lsp`, `rust-analyzer-lsp`, `gopls-lsp` | Jump to definitions, find references, see type errors |
| **External integrations** | `github`, `gitlab`, `slack`, `linear`, `notion`, `figma` | Connect to external services |
| **Development workflows** | `commit-commands`, `pr-review-toolkit`, `plugin-dev` | Git workflows, PR reviews, plugin creation |
| **Output styles** | `explanatory-output-style`, `learning-output-style` | Customize how Claude responds |

### Code Intelligence Plugins

These use the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP)—the same technology that powers VS Code's code intelligence.

**After installing** (e.g., `typescript-lsp`), Claude can:
- Jump to function definitions
- Find all references to a variable
- See type errors immediately after edits

**Note**: LSP plugins require the language server binary installed on your system. If you see "Executable not found," install the required binary:

| Plugin | Binary Required |
|--------|-----------------|
| `typescript-lsp` | `typescript-language-server` |
| `python-lsp` | `pyright-langserver` |
| `rust-analyzer-lsp` | `rust-analyzer` |
| `gopls-lsp` | `gopls` |

### External Integration Plugins

Connect Claude to services you already use:

```
/plugin install github@claude-plugins-official
```

Now Claude can interact with GitHub issues, PRs, and repositories directly.

---

## Installation Scopes

When you install a plugin, choose where it applies:

| Scope | Who Uses It | Where It's Stored |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **User** | Just you, all projects | `~/.claude/` |
| **Project** | Everyone on this repo | `.claude/settings.json` |
| **Local** | Just you, this repo only | Local settings |

**Recommendation**: Start with **User scope** for personal tools, **Project scope** for team standards.

---

## Managing Plugins

### See What's Installed

```
/plugin
```

Go to the **Installed** tab.

### Disable Without Uninstalling

```
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

### Re-enable

```
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

### Completely Remove

```
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

---

## Adding More Marketplaces

The official marketplace is just the start. You can add others:

**GitHub repositories**:
```
/plugin marketplace add owner/repo
```

**GitLab or other git hosts**:
```
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

**Local development**:
```
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

### The Demo Marketplace

Anthropic maintains a demo marketplace with example plugins:

```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

This shows what's possible with the plugin system.

---

## When to Use Plugins vs. Build Custom

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Standard task (git, GitHub, Slack) | Install existing plugin |
| Team-specific workflow | Check marketplace first, then build custom |
| Learning how plugins work | Install examples, study their structure |
| No matching plugin exists | Create custom (advanced, Part 5+) |

**Rule of thumb**: Check the marketplace before building from scratch.

---

### What's Next

Lesson 15 introduces the **Ralph Wiggum Loop**—an autonomous iteration pattern where Claude validates and refines its own work. You'll see how to combine everything you've learned (skills, subagents, hooks, plugins) into self-correcting workflows.

## Try With AI

**🔍 Explore the Marketplace:**

> "Run /plugin and show me what's in the Discover tab. What categories of plugins are available? Which ones would be useful for [your work: web development / Python / data analysis]?"

**What you're learning:** Plugin discovery—understanding what capability extensions exist before building from scratch. The ecosystem often has what you need.

**📦 Install and Test:**

> "Help me install the commit-commands plugin. After it's installed, walk me through using /commit-commands:commit to commit a change. What other commands does this plugin provide?"

**What you're learning:** The full plugin workflow—from installation through verification. Knowing the complete cycle builds confidence with new plugins.

**🔌 Code Intelligence:**

> "I write [TypeScript / Python / Rust / Go]. Help me install the LSP plugin for my language. What do I need to install on my system first? After installation, show me how Claude can now jump to definitions and find references."

**What you're learning:** How plugins add capabilities Claude doesn't have natively—in this case, language-server-level code understanding.

**🔗 External Integration:**

> "I want to connect Claude to [GitHub / Slack / Linear]. Help me install the appropriate plugin. What capabilities does it add? Show me an example of using it."

**What you're learning:** Platform integration through plugins—extending Claude's reach to external services without writing custom MCP servers.

**⚖️ Plugin Decision:**

> "I need Claude to help with [describe your task]. Should I: (a) install an existing plugin, (b) create a custom skill, (c) just ask Claude directly? Help me decide based on what's available in the marketplace."

**What you're learning:** The build vs. buy decision for AI capabilities—when to use existing solutions vs. creating custom ones.
