# Logical Operators — Combining Conditions

## What Are Logical Operators?

In Lesson 2, you learned about comparison operators. They answer questions: "Is x greater than 5?" (True or False). But what if you need to ask a **more complex question**? For example, "Is x greater than 5 AND less than 10?" That's where logical operators come in.

Logical operators let you **combine boolean values** (True/False) to make more sophisticated decisions. They're the glue that joins multiple conditions together, and they're essential for the control flow we'll learn in Chapter 17. Think of them as the language of reasoning: "this AND that," "this OR that," "NOT that."

Three logical operators unlock this power:
- **`and`** — True only if BOTH conditions are True
- **`or`** — True if AT LEAST ONE condition is True
- **`not`** — Reverses a boolean value (True becomes False, False becomes True)

## The Three Logical Operators

Let's start with truth tables. A truth table shows all possible combinations of boolean inputs and what each operator returns. This is where the logic becomes crystal clear:

### The `and` Operator

`and` returns True only when **BOTH** operands are True:

| Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Result |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| True | True | **True** |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| False | False | False |

**Real-world example**: You can withdraw money from your bank account if you have the correct PIN AND you have money in the account. Both must be true, or you can't withdraw.

### The `or` Operator

`or` returns True if **AT LEAST ONE** operand is True:

| Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Result |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| True | True | **True** |
| True | False | **True** |
| False | True | **True** |
| False | False | False |

**Real-world example**: You can watch a movie if you have a theater ticket OR you're a subscriber to a streaming service. You don't need both—either one is enough.

### The `not` Operator

`not` **reverses** a boolean value:

| Input | Result |
|-------|--------|
| True | **False** |
| False | **True** |

**Real-world example**: If the statement "It is raining" is True, then "Not raining" is False. If "It is raining" is False, then "Not raining" is True.

## Code Example 1: The Three Logical Operators

Here's a program demonstrating all three operators working with boolean values:

```python
# The 3 logical operators with boolean values
condition1: bool = True
condition2: bool = False

# AND: True only if BOTH are True
and_result: bool = condition1 and condition2     # False (one is False)
print(f"True and False = {and_result}")          # False

# OR: True if AT LEAST ONE is True
or_result: bool = condition1 or condition2       # True (at least one is True)
print(f"True or False = {or_result}")            # True

# NOT: Reverses the value
not_result1: bool = not condition1               # False (True becomes False)
print(f"not True = {not_result1}")               # False

not_result2: bool = not condition2               # True (False becomes True)
print(f"not False = {not_result2}")              # True

# Truth table for AND
print("\n--- AND Truth Table ---")
print(f"True and True = {True and True}")        # True
print(f"True and False = {True and False}")      # False
print(f"False and True = {False and True}")      # False
print(f"False and False = {False and False}")    # False

# Truth table for OR
print("\n--- OR Truth Table ---")
print(f"True or True = {True or True}")          # True
print(f"True or False = {True or False}")        # True
print(f"False or True = {False or True}")        # True
print(f"False or False = {False or False}")      # False
```

**Specification: Demonstrate all three logical operators with truth table behavior**

**AI Prompt Used:**
"Write Python code that shows all three logical operators (and, or, not) with type hints. Create truth tables showing all combinations of True and False for and/or. Include the not operator reversing values. Verify all results are bool type."

**Generated Code Output:**
The code above demonstrates all three operators systematically, showing truth tables that reveal the logic.

**Validation Steps:**
1. ✓ All three operators (and, or, not) present and correct
2. ✓ Type hints show all results are bool
3. ✓ Truth tables demonstrate all 4 combinations for and/or
4. ✓ not operator correctly reverses True/False
5. ✓ Code runs without errors

## Code Example 2: Combining Comparisons with Logical Operators

Now comes the power move: combining comparison operators (from Lesson 2) with logical operators. This is how you ask complex questions:

```python
# Combining comparisons with logical operators
x: int = 7

# Is x between 5 and 10? (BOTH conditions must be True)
in_range: bool = (x > 5) and (x < 10)            # True (both conditions met)
print(f"Is {x} between 5 and 10? {in_range}")    # True

# Is x outside the range [5, 10]? (EITHER condition can be True)
out_of_range: bool = (x <= 5) or (x >= 10)      # False (neither condition met)
print(f"Is {x} outside [5, 10]? {out_of_range}") # False

# Is x NOT in range? (Reverse the result)
not_in_range: bool = not ((x > 5) and (x < 10))  # False (it IS in range)
print(f"Is {x} NOT in range? {not_in_range}")    # False

# Real-world scenario: User access control
print("\n--- User Access Control ---")
is_logged_in: bool = True
is_member_7_days: bool = True
is_admin: bool = False

# Can post? (logged in AND member 7+ days OR is admin)
can_post: bool = (is_logged_in and is_member_7_days) or is_admin
print(f"Can post? {can_post}")  # True (both logged_in and member conditions met)

# Can delete comments? (admin only)
can_delete: bool = is_admin and is_logged_in
print(f"Can delete comments? {can_delete}")  # False (not admin)

# Can view content? (logged in, regardless of other permissions)
can_view: bool = is_logged_in
print(f"Can view content? {can_view}")  # True (simply logged in)
```

**Specification: Combine comparison operators with logical operators to solve real-world conditions**

**AI Prompt Used:**
"Write Python code that combines comparisons (>, <, ==, !=) with logical operators (and, or, not). Show range checking (is x between 5 and 10?). Create a realistic permission-checking scenario with is_logged_in, is_member_7_days, and is_admin variables. Show how to write conditions for 'can post', 'can delete', and 'can view'."

**Generated Code Output:**
The code above demonstrates combining operators to solve real-world logic problems.

**Validation Steps:**
1. ✓ Comparisons (>, <) combined with and/or correctly
2. ✓ Range check uses proper syntax: (x > 5) and (x < 10)
3. ✓ Real-world permission logic works as expected
4. ✓ All boolean results are accurate
5. ✓ Code runs on Python 3.14+ without errors

## Code Example 3: Evaluation Order and Parentheses

When you combine multiple logical operators, **evaluation order matters**. Parentheses control which parts are evaluated first. This is like operator precedence in arithmetic — but for logic.

```python
# Understanding evaluation order with parentheses
age: int = 25
has_license: bool = True
has_insurance: bool = False

print("--- Evaluation Order ---")

# Can drive? (age 18+ AND licensed AND insured)
# All three must be True
can_drive: bool = (age >= 18) and has_license and has_insurance
print(f"Can drive (all 3)? {can_drive}")  # False (insurance is False)

# Can drive OR is young adult with license?
# Without parentheses, evaluation follows operator precedence
is_adult: bool = age >= 18
is_adult_with_license: bool = is_adult and has_license
print(f"Adult with license? {is_adult_with_license}")  # True

# Now add insurance requirement ONLY for non-adults
can_take_car_v1: bool = (age >= 18) or (age < 18 and has_insurance)
print(f"Can take car (v1)? {can_take_car_v1}")  # True (age >= 18 is True)

# Different interpretation with different parentheses
# Must be adult AND (have license OR have insurance)
can_take_car_v2: bool = (age >= 18) and (has_license or has_insurance)
print(f"Can take car (v2)? {can_take_car_v2}")  # True (adult AND license is True)

# Compare to wrong parentheses
can_take_car_v3: bool = age >= 18 and has_license or has_insurance
print(f"Can take car (v3)? {can_take_car_v3}")  # True (different meaning!)

print("\n--- Breaking Down Complex Expressions ---")

# Let's trace through a complex expression step by step
condition1: bool = True
condition2: bool = False
condition3: bool = True

# Expression: (condition1 or condition2) and (not condition3)
step1: bool = condition1 or condition2     # True or False = True
step2: bool = not condition3               # not True = False
result: bool = step1 and step2             # True and False = False

print(f"(True or False) and (not True)")
print(f"  = {step1} and {step2}")
print(f"  = {result}")

# Parentheses matter!
result_alt: bool = condition1 or (condition2 and (not condition3))
print(f"\nAlternative: True or (False and (not True))")
print(f"  = {result_alt}")  # True (because condition1 is True, or short-circuits)
```

**Specification: Show how parentheses control evaluation order in logical expressions**

**AI Prompt Used:**
"Write Python code that demonstrates how parentheses change the meaning of logical expressions. Show an example where (A and B) or C gives a different result than A and (B or C). Include step-by-step evaluation showing what each part evaluates to. Use realistic variable names like age, has_license, has_insurance."

**Generated Code Output:**
The code above shows parentheses controlling evaluation and step-by-step tracing.

**Validation Steps:**
1. ✓ Multiple parentheses placements shown clearly
2. ✓ Step-by-step evaluation demonstrates order
3. ✓ Results show how parentheses change meaning
4. ✓ Type hints throughout
5. ✓ Code is educational and runnable

## Why This Matters: Bridge to Chapter 17

Lesson 3 is the most cognitively demanding lesson in Chapter 15 because you're tracking **multiple boolean values simultaneously**. That mental juggling is hard work. But notice this: you're learning **the exact logic** that powers if statements in Chapter 17.

When you write:
```python
if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive")
```

You're using the exact same logical operators you just learned. The `if` statement simply **acts on** the True/False result that `and` produces. By mastering logical operators now, Chapter 17 becomes straightforward—you already know how to reason about conditions.

## Try With AI

This section offers four progressive prompts to deepen your understanding of logical operators with AI assistance. Work through them in order, and don't skip the more challenging ones—that's where real learning happens.

### Prompt 1: Concept Exploration

**Tell your AI:**

```
I'm learning about logical operators and I'm confused about the differences.
- When does `and` return True?
- When does `or` return True?
- Why do we need `not`?

Give me simple examples that make the difference clear. Use the same operands (True and False) for all examples so I can see the pattern.
```

**Expected outcome:** You learn the truth conditions for each operator through clear examples. You understand that `and` requires both, `or` needs only one, and `not` reverses. You see the fundamental difference between AND logic (both required) and OR logic (either sufficient).

---

### Prompt 2: Application — User Permissions

**Tell your AI:**

```
Write Python code for a permission system:
- A user can post if: they are logged in AND they've been a member for 7+ days
- Exception: admins can always post

Write the conditions for:
1. can_post with both requirements
2. can_post_as_admin (admin override)
3. final_can_post that combines both

Show me the code with type hints and explain when each condition is True.
```

**Expected outcome:** You apply logical operators to realistic permission logic. You understand the difference between `and` (both required) and `or` (either sufficient). You see how conditions scale to real-world scenarios. You practice writing conditions that mirror business rules.

**What to validate:**
1. Run the code the AI provides
2. Test it: change is_logged_in to False and see can_post become False
3. Change is_admin to True and verify can_post_as_admin becomes True
4. Ask follow-up: "What if we wanted to require 7 days OR admin status? How would that code change?"

---

### Prompt 3: Edge Case Discovery — Complex Logic

**Tell your AI:**

```
Evaluate these boolean expressions step-by-step:
1. True and False or True
2. not (True or False)
3. (True and False) or (True and True)
4. True or False and False

For each one:
- Tell me the step-by-step evaluation
- Tell me the final result (True or False)
- Explain operator precedence (which operations happen first)

Which ones surprised you?
```

**Expected outcome:** You practice evaluating complex boolean expressions. You discover operator precedence rules (`not` > `and` > `or`). You learn that without parentheses, Python follows specific precedence rules. You see why parentheses matter for clarity and correctness.

**What to validate:**
1. Run each expression in Python yourself
2. See the actual results
3. Ask follow-up: "How do parentheses change the result? Show me (True and False or True) vs (True and (False or True))."

---

### Prompt 4: Synthesis — Connection to Chapter 17

**Tell your AI:**

```
I understand how logical operators work now (and, or, not), but I don't see why we learned this in Chapter 15 when Chapter 17 teaches if statements.

Help me understand:
1. How do logical operators connect to if statements?
2. Show me an if statement that uses and/or/not
3. How do logical operators enable complex decision-making?

Connect the dots between Chapter 15 operators and Chapter 17 control flow.
```

**Expected outcome:** You understand that logical operators are the **foundation** for conditional statements. You see that `if age >= 18 and has_license:` uses the exact `and` operator you learned. You recognize that if statements simply **act on** the True/False results that logical operators produce. You appreciate the progression: Chapter 15 teaches the logic, Chapter 17 teaches control flow that uses that logic.

**Key insight:** Logical operators are how you express human reasoning in code. When you say "I can go to the party if I'm invited AND I'm free," you're using AND logic. Python's `and` operator expresses that same reasoning.

---

### Safety & Verification Note

When experimenting with logical operators:

- **✓ Do**: Test your predictions. Write conditions and verify they return what you expect
- **✓ Do**: Use type() to verify results are always bool
- **✓ Do**: Ask "What happens if I add parentheses?" to deepen understanding
- **✓ Do**: Break complex expressions into steps, evaluating each part
- **⚠️ Be aware**: Operator precedence (`not` > `and` > `or`) might surprise you without parentheses
- **✓ Do**: Ask follow-up questions when results are unexpected

Remember: Logical operators are tools for reasoning, not just syntax. When you write `age >= 18 and has_license`, you're expressing a **logical requirement** — both must be true. Mastering this thinking pattern now will make control flow and advanced programs click into place.
