# Chapter 13: Introduction to Modern Python

Welcome to your journey into Python programming through the lens of AI-native development. In this chapter, you'll discover what Python is, why it matters for building intelligent systems, set up your development environment, and write your first program—all while learning to partner with AI as your thinking assistant.

## What You'll Learn

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Explain** what Python is and why it's central to AI-native software development
2. **Install** Python 3.14.0 on your computer and verify your setup
3. **Write and run** your first Python program that interacts with users using type hints
4. **Use** Claude Code or Gemini CLI as your thinking partner when learning code
5. **Apply** specification-first thinking from Chapter 4 to coding tasks

## Learning Path: Four Progressive Lessons

This chapter progresses from foundational concepts to professional practice:

- **Lesson 1** (45 min): What is Python and why it matters for AIDD
- **Lesson 2** (30 min): Installing Python 3.14.0 and setting up your environment
- **Lesson 3** (45 min): Writing and running your first program with type hints
- **Lesson 4** (30 min, optional): Applying specification-first thinking to code generation

All four lessons are designed for learners at all levels. Lessons 1-3 build essential skills. Lesson 4 connects Python to the AIDD methodology you learned in Chapters 1-11, showing how specification-first thinking and AI partnership transform how you develop.

**Total time**: 2-2.5 hours depending on whether you complete Lesson 4

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes you've completed:

- **Chapters 1-4**: AIDD fundamentals and the Nine Pillars (specification-first thinking)
- **Chapters 5-6**: Claude Code and Gemini CLI basics
- **Chapter 7**: Bash essentials (terminal commands)
- **Chapter 10**: Prompt engineering (asking AI good questions)

If you haven't completed these chapters, we recommend finishing them first. They establish the foundation that makes this chapter meaningful.

## How to Use AI in This Chapter

Throughout this chapter, you'll see prompts designed for Claude Code or Gemini CLI. Here's how it works:

1. **Understand the concept** (the book explains it)
2. **See minimal code** (the example shows what it does)
3. **Ask your AI partner** (you explore through dialogue)
4. **Extract insight** (you learn why this matters for thinking)

This is the **AI-Driven Way**: you don't memorize Python—you learn to reason about it with intelligent assistance. You're not asking AI to code for you. You're asking AI to help you understand, explain, and explore.

## Key Topics

This chapter covers:

- **Python Fundamentals**: What Python is, its characteristics, and why it dominates AI development
- **Modern Python Syntax**: Type hints and f-strings for clarity and specification-first thinking
- **Setup & Verification**: Installing Python 3.14.0 and confirming your environment
- **First Program**: Writing interactive programs with input/output and type hints
- **Specification-First Coding**: How to apply Chapter 4's methodology to code generation with AI
- **AI Partnership**: Using Claude Code and Gemini CLI as reasoning partners, not just code generators

## Getting Started

Start with Lesson 1 and work through the lessons in order. Each lesson builds on the previous one.

**All four lessons are valuable**. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find something valuable in each lesson. Lesson 4 is particularly useful if you want to deepen your understanding of how AI partnership accelerates development.

**Remember**: Throughout this chapter, ask Claude Code or Gemini CLI questions. They're your thinking partners, not just code generators. Learning to ask good questions is as important as writing code.

Let's build something.
